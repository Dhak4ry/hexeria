       Blue economy is a term in economics relating to the exploitation and preservation of the marine environment. 
       Its scope of interpretation varies among organizations.According to the World Bank, the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem." The Center for the Blue Economy says "it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings
       -the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries.
